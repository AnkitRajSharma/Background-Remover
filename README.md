🖼️ Background Removal Website

This project is a Django-based web application that allows users to upload an image and remove its background.

Currently, the project is under development 🚧.

✅ The background removal feature is working.

⚠️ However, the AI model is not fully trained yet, so the results may not always be accurate.

🏗️ Other features are planned and will be added in future updates.

📂 Project Structure

Frontend: Django templates with Tailwind CSS for styling.

Backend: Django framework handling image upload and processing.

Image Processing: AI-based segmentation model for background removal.

⚡ Current Functionality

🛠️ Work in Progress

This website is still in process of development.
At present, only the background removal module is working, but since the model is under training, the accuracy may vary.

Future updates will include:
